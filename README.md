![Spectral lint workflow](https://github.com/lfsgroup/channel-partner-api-docs/actions/workflows/spectral_lint/badge.svg)

Stoplight uses the [spectral lint tool](https://github.com/stoplightio/spectral), so, we have a github pipeline triggered to run spectral on `push`.
(Users are encouraged to install spectral locally, and run the lint command, to test any changes - details [here](https://github.com/stoplightio/spectral)
